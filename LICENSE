    before any deductions for costs, expenses, or fees.

  - Example 1: Agronomy service charges $500/hectare for analysis
               → License fee: $5/hectare (1% of gross)
  - Example 2: Consulting firm charges $10,000 for restoration planning
               → License fee: $100 per engagement (1% of gross)
  - Example 3: SaaS platform charges $2,000/month subscription
               → License fee: $20/month per subscriber (1% of gross)

**How to Obtain a Commercial License:**

  1. **Contact for License Agreement Template or Custom Terms:**
     - Email: licensing@negentropic.org
     - GitHub Issue: https://github.com/dj-ccs/negentropic-core/issues
       (Subject: "[COMMERCIAL LICENSE REQUEST]")
     - We respond within 5 business days

  2. Provide details of your intended commercial use:
     - Nature of service/product

**Evaluation Period:**

Commercial entities may use this Software for internal evaluation and testing
for up to 90 days without payment. This grace period allows organizations to
assess suitability and integration requirements before entering into a
Commercial License Agreement. After 90 days, continued commercial use requires
an executed license agreement with ongoing revenue share payments.

**Exemptions:**

The following are NOT considered commercial use (use Research License instead):
  - Internal R&D at for-profit companies (not customer-facing)
  - Pilot studies and proof-of-concept projects (non-revenue-generating)
  - Open-source projects released under GPL-3.0 or compatible licenses

**Prohibited Uses:**

The following uses are expressly prohibited under any license:
  - Reverse-engineering this Software to create competing products that
    undermine the open research ecosystem
  - Using this Software to create proprietary "black box" systems that
    obscure scientific methodology
  - Redistributing modified versions without clear attribution and changelog
  - Any use that violates the spirit of open science and regenerative economics

**Enforcement:**

Unauthorized commercial use is a violation of copyright law. We reserve the
right to:
  - Audit usage upon reasonable notice
  - Seek injunctive relief and damages for unauthorized use
  - Terminate licenses for non-compliance
  - Revoke licenses for prohibited uses outlined above

However, our goal is collaboration, not litigation. We will work in good faith
with all users to find fair and sustainable licensing arrangements that support
both your success and the continued development of this open research platform.

All contributors retain copyright to their contributions but agree to license
them under the terms of this dual-license structure.

================================================================================
WHY THIS LICENSE STRUCTURE?
================================================================================

We believe that scientific knowledge should be freely accessible for research
and public good, while commercial applications should contribute to the ongoing
R&D, maintenance, and improvement of the tools they profit from.

This dual-license structure:
  ✓ Enables free academic research and open science
  ✓ Supports NGOs and nonprofits working on restoration
  ✓ Encourages open-source ecosystem development
  ✓ Creates sustainable funding for long-term maintenance
  ✓ Ensures commercial users contribute proportionally to value received
  ✓ Keeps the fee low (1%) to encourage adoption over reinvention

**Our Commitment:**

Revenue from commercial licenses will be reinvested in:
  - Ongoing R&D and scientific validation
  - Performance optimization and new features
  - Documentation and educational resources
  - Community support and collaboration
  - Open publication of research findings
  - **Real-world restoration projects** that generate validation data

**The Self-Reinforcing Loop:**

This creates a regenerative feedback cycle:
  1. Commercial success → Revenue for R&D and real-world restoration
  2. Real restoration → Better validation data and scientific insights
  3. Better science → More accurate simulation engine
  4. Better engine → More commercial adoption
  5. Repeat → **Pure negentropy**

The more this engine helps heal landscapes commercially, the more resources
flow back to improve the science and fund actual ecosystem restoration.
