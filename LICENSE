All contributors retain copyright to their contributions but agree to license
them under the terms of this dual-license structure.

================================================================================
WHY THIS LICENSE STRUCTURE?
================================================================================

We believe that scientific knowledge should be freely accessible for research
and public good, while commercial applications should contribute to the ongoing
R&D, maintenance, and improvement of the tools they profit from.

This dual-license structure:
  ✓ Enables free academic research and open science
  ✓ Supports NGOs and nonprofits working on restoration
  ✓ Encourages open-source ecosystem development
  ✓ Creates sustainable funding for long-term maintenance
  ✓ Ensures commercial users contribute proportionally to value received
  ✓ Keeps the fee low (1%) to encourage adoption over reinvention

**Our Commitment:**

Revenue from commercial licenses will be reinvested in:
  - Ongoing R&D and scientific validation
  - Performance optimization and new features
  - Documentation and educational resources
  - Community support and collaboration
  - Open publication of research findings
