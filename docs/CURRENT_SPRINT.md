# CURRENT SPRINT: [GEO-v1] Visualization Layer

## Goal
To build the web-based, interactive user interface for `negentropic-core`, bringing the physics simulation to life in the browser.

## Core Tasks
1.  **[GEO-PROTO] Cesium + deck.gl Prototype:** Build the 3-thread application skeleton.
2.  **[GEO-DATA] Prithvi Adapter:** Implement the AI model for initial state seeding.
3.  **[GEO-WASM] Core Engine Integration:** Connect the live, benchmarked physics solvers to the visualization layer.

## Success Criteria
A live, 60 FPS web application where a user can select a real-world location, seed it with satellite data, and watch our engine's regenerative cascade come to life.
